HP ProLiant Firmware Update JSON Formatter
------------------------------------------

Checking manually for new firmware updates is tedious work. This is the first 
step in automating this task.

Currently, Makefile downloads the current catalog XML, and then transforms it
into JSON, filtering on RHEL5, English only.

It's up to the user to select the newest firmware and apply it ;)
