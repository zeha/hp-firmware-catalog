HP ProLiant Firmware Update JSON Formatter
------------------------------------------

Checking manually for new firmware updates is tedious work. This is the first 
step in automating this task.

Currently, Makefile downloads the current catalog XML, and then transforms it
into JSON, filtering on RHEL5, English only.

It's up to the user to select the newest firmware and apply it ;)

For licensing information, please see the file COPYING.

Output data:
------------

"sw_keys" seems to be what HP uses to identify the hardware component.
Different firmware updates for the same hardware component will carry the same
sw_keys.

Known components <-> sw_keys:
  * RAID controllers: PCI ID
  * System ROM: some ID
  * ILO: some ID
  * Power Management Controllers: "PowerPIC-*"
  * Hard drives: Vendor ID (e.g. "ST31000340NS")


Installation
------------

You will need make, xsltproc, and the python simplejson library installed on
your system.

On a Debian system install the following packages using APT:

  apt-get install make python-simplejson xsltproc
